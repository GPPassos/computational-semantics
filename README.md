# Computational Semantics (Work in Progress)
Repository for Bachelor's Thesis (final project) in Applied Mathematics at Fundação Getulio Vargas, supervised by [Alexandre Rademaker] (http://arademaker.github.io/)

We work with Blackburn & Bos files, integrating with Wordnet and doing other exercises.

The thesis text is avaiable at texto/tcc_gppassos.pdf

# Requirements

- Prolog (we use [Prolog SWI](http://www.swi-prolog.org/) )
- Otter and Mace2: avaiable at https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/otter/

# Usage

Access `BB1` folder and from there call `prolog`. You'll probably want to use our modifications from `kellerStorage.pl` or `helpfulCurt.pl`:

```bash
prolog
```
```prolog
[helpfulCurt.pl].
curt.
```

For an example, you can then type
```
A king loves a dying dragon
```
